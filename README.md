# Apache Jena website

The `asf-staging` branch is only used for storing the generated static website for previewing proposed changes to the website.

The preview site is at https://jena.staged.apache.org

The javadoc is stored on a separate branch `javadoc` but is also included into the staging site.

When submitting patches, apply them to the `main` branch instead of the asf-site branch.  Any PR based on a branch off of `main`
will automatically be built and staged here.
