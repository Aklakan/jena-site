Title: Jena JDBC - A SPARQL over JDBC driver

Jena JDBC is a set of libraries which provide SPARQL over JDBC driver implementations.

This is a pure SPARQL over JDBC implementation, there is no attempt to present the underlying
RDF data model as a relational model through the driver and only SPARQL queries and updates
are supported.  Otherwise it is a fully fledge type 4 JDBC driver.

## Documentation

A general overview of the functionality of the drivers is given later on this page, the
following additional documentation topics are also available.

- [Jena JDBC Drivers](drivers.html)
- [Implementing a custom Jena JDBC Driver](custom_driver.html)

## Overview

Jena JDBC aims to be a pure SPARQL over JDBC driver, it assumes that all commands that come in are
either SPARQL queries or updates and processes them as such.

As detailed on the [drivers](drivers.html) page there are actually three drivers provided currently:

- In-Memory - uses an in-memory dataset to provide non-persistent storage
- TDB - uses a [TDB](/documentation/tdb/) dataset to provide persistent and transactional storage
- Remote - uses HTTP based remote endpoints to access any SPARQL protocol compliant storage

These are all built on a core library which can be used to build [custom drivers](custom_driver.html)
if desired.  This means that all drivers share common infrastructure and thus exhibit broadly speaking
the same behaviors.


## Alternatives

If Jena JDBC does not fulfill your use case you may also be interested in some 3rd party
projects which do SPARQL over JDBC in other ways:

- [Claude Warren's jdbc4sparql](https://github.com/Claudenw/jdbc4sparql) - An alternative approach that does expose
the underlying RDF data model as a relational model and supports translating SQL into SPARQL
- [William Greenly's jdbc4sparql](http://code.google.com/p/jdbc4sparql/) - A similar approach to Jena JDBC restricted
to accessing HTTP based SPARQL endpoints
- [Paul Gearon's scon](https://code.google.com/p/scon/wiki/Introduction) - A similar approach to Jena JDBC restricted
to accessing HTTP based SPARQL endpoints
