Title: TDB Download and Installation

## TDB Downloads

Currently, TDB is a separate download from the main release of Jena. 
The TDB download includes a compatible copy of Jena.

See the [Jena downloads page](/jena/downloads/) for details of Jena download area.

TDB is distributed as a complete download and also via Apache Maven
(groupId `or.apache.jena`, artifact `jena-tdb`).

After downloading a TDB distribution, place *all* the jars in the
`lib/` directory on the classpath. TDB itself is a single jar, the
other jars in `lib/` are a consistent set of dependencies 
requires at runtime.

## Maven

     <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.jena</groupId>
        <artifactId>jena-tdb</artifactId>
        <version>VER-incubating</version>
    </dependency>

where <i>VER</i> is the version number.  This will pull-in the relevant version of other 
Jena components.
