Title: ARQ: using SPARQL with Jena

Jena fully supports the SPARQL standards for querying and updating RDF models, including
tracking the features of SPARQL 1.1 as they are finalised by W3C.

Documentation is in the process being ported from the old Jena site to Apache.
In the meantime, please use the following links for detailed information on SPARQL support
in Jena:
